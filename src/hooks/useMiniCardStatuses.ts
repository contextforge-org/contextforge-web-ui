/**
 * useMiniCardStatuses — gathers the data behind the home mini-card statuses and
 * the status headline, mapping the shared `/version` health signal to both the
 * pure `computeMiniCardStatuses` model and the `resolveHeadline` condition.
 *
 * Sources: `/version` (backend health, via useSystemHealth), reachability
 * probes for MCP servers (`/gateways`) and A2A agents (`/a2a`), and recent
 * activity for error/warning counts. Activity is fetched once (no polling) to
 * keep the resting home quiet; it is empty until the activity backend (#5944)
 * lands.
 *
 * `/version` is admin-only, so it is fetched only when the caller can view
 * system diagnostics (`admin.system_config`); non-admins never poll a guaranteed
 * 403. It is polled once here (the hook is resolved at the page level) and feeds
 * both the mini cards and the headline. Activity is gated the same way on
 * `audit:read`.
